00:00.990 --> 00:04.070
What is a hash function.

00:04.170 --> 00:12.850
It's something that's used all across computer science a hash function is simply a function that generates

00:12.850 --> 00:19.160
a value of fixed length for each input that it gets.

00:19.180 --> 00:19.580
All right.

00:19.580 --> 00:21.260
What does that mean.

00:21.260 --> 00:28.250
Well I have here a empty five hash generated empty five is the type of hash function.

00:28.250 --> 00:37.520
And there's many many types you might have heard of SHA 1 shot 256 and many others using this hash function.

00:37.570 --> 00:40.270
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS IF I DO.

00:40.390 --> 00:42.590
HELLO.

00:42.630 --> 00:44.570
YOU SEE THAT RIGHT AWAY.

00:44.570 --> 00:55.280
AND THESE FIVE HASHES this string and turns it into this gibberish that's what a hash function does.

00:55.550 --> 01:03.470
We give it an input and the function generates some random pattern.

01:03.470 --> 01:07.550
Now there's some key aspects of hash functions.

01:07.550 --> 01:16.670
First is that it's one way in the sense that if I give somebody this they have no idea what the input

01:16.670 --> 01:17.630
was.

01:17.990 --> 01:24.790
And it's practically impossible for me to have any clue as to what the input is.

01:24.800 --> 01:31.590
The second is that no matter how many times I put Hello in there it's going to be the same.

01:31.760 --> 01:38.840
But I soon as I change one thing it's going to completely change the output.

01:38.840 --> 01:46.270
If I go back to hello and watch me just change to capital H even a capital letter.

01:46.320 --> 01:48.640
So it starts with five D four.

01:49.130 --> 01:53.020
If I do capital H it's completely different.

01:53.040 --> 01:58.230
Again and looking at this we can at least say that.

01:58.250 --> 01:58.950
Mm hmm.

01:59.140 --> 02:05.050
I don't know what this is useful for but the one thing that I know is that no matter what if I give

02:05.050 --> 02:11.560
it the same input it's going to give me the same result but I have no idea how to convert this back

02:11.570 --> 02:13.550
into Hello.

02:13.690 --> 02:18.230
This is what we call indent potent or indent potent.

02:18.310 --> 02:20.110
There's different pronunciations.

02:20.110 --> 02:26.320
I'm not really sure which ones which but it is a fancy way of saying that a function given an input

02:26.440 --> 02:29.750
always outputs the same output.

02:29.810 --> 02:37.700
Now the one benefit and why we would want to use this in a data structure is that we get really fast

02:37.850 --> 02:51.230
dad access because all I have to do to find grapes or basket dot grapes is to pass grapes into something

02:51.230 --> 02:58.490
like an empty five hash it generates this number for me and I immediately know where it is in my memory

02:58.940 --> 03:02.600
on our computer but this doesn't look like an address.

03:02.610 --> 03:11.480
Does it technically a hash function that we use for hash tables is going to take grapes generate some

03:11.480 --> 03:20.210
sort of gibberish and then converted to an index space or an address space that it has based on this

03:20.210 --> 03:22.250
number.

03:22.410 --> 03:32.210
You see unlike a race where we just had ordered indexes with hash tables all we need to do is give it

03:32.210 --> 03:39.890
a key and we know exactly where that item is in our memory but you might be wondering this black box

03:39.960 --> 03:43.070
hash function doesn't it slow things down.

03:43.280 --> 03:52.970
Because every time we want to add a prop. And a value grapes and ten thousand two hash table we have

03:52.970 --> 03:58.640
to run it through the hash function so we can decide where to put it in memory.

03:58.640 --> 04:00.560
And if you've noticed that.

04:00.680 --> 04:01.430
Good job.

04:01.430 --> 04:03.350
That is a big factor.

04:03.500 --> 04:10.940
You don't want this to take a very long time because well every time you add a property to memory or

04:10.940 --> 04:18.410
retrieve a property to memory because again we add both times we're sending the key grapes into the

04:18.410 --> 04:21.420
hash function to find where to get it from.

04:21.470 --> 04:23.900
We need this to be really really fast.

04:24.560 --> 04:31.820
And underneath the hood remember because hash tables exist in all languages they're implemented with

04:31.820 --> 04:35.750
an optimum hashing function that's really really fast.

04:37.090 --> 04:47.960
As a side note hash functions like SHA 256 take a really long time to generate a hash and it is an overly

04:47.960 --> 04:57.020
complex hashing function that is used a lot in places like cryptography where you want this to take

04:57.620 --> 05:01.010
longer but that is outside the scope of this course.

05:01.190 --> 05:08.880
If you're interested I do recommend that you check out the differences between these two to review.

05:08.880 --> 05:11.730
We have a key that is grapes.

05:11.730 --> 05:18.240
We send it through a hash function that is going to hash something really really fast and then map whatever

05:18.240 --> 05:29.890
the hash came out to be into a memory address where we want to store our data our grapes 10000 and when

05:29.890 --> 05:35.440
it comes to hashing functions you typically leave this to whatever framework or language you're using

05:36.100 --> 05:44.740
and we usually assume a time complexity or Big O notation of 0 1 because this happens really fast.

05:44.740 --> 05:45.230
All right.

05:45.310 --> 05:48.070
Now that we understand what this black box does.

05:48.190 --> 05:54.970
Let's talk a little bit more about hash tables why they're useful and why in some cases are better than

05:54.980 --> 05:55.390
arrays.

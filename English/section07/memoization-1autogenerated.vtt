00:01.180 --> 00:09.550
In order to understand how dynamic programming works we need to understand what caching means caching

00:09.580 --> 00:13.630
is a way to store values so you can use them later on.

00:14.320 --> 00:23.240
Ideally you can think of caching as a backpack they take to school instead of going all the way home

00:23.360 --> 00:25.540
when you need something like a pencil.

00:25.640 --> 00:34.940
You have a small box on your back that holds items that you need so that when you go to school you can

00:34.940 --> 00:38.310
just reuse them fast over and over.

00:38.350 --> 00:40.720
Now that's a bit of a silly example.

00:40.720 --> 00:48.700
Caching is just a way for us to speed up programs and hold some piece of data in an easily accessible

00:48.700 --> 00:55.690
box and memorization is a specific form of caching that we're going to be talking about because we use

00:55.690 --> 00:57.780
it a lot in dynamic programming.

00:58.090 --> 01:06.540
But instead of just talking about it let's actually demonstrated it in code the way we can cache things.

01:06.540 --> 01:14.910
Well let's imagine we have a function that says we want to add to 80 and this function takes a number

01:16.030 --> 01:21.960
and all it does is return the value of n..

01:22.060 --> 01:25.740
That is a parameter we give it and adds 80 to it.

01:26.870 --> 01:36.590
So that when we run the function add to 80 and let's say we put in five we get eighty five nice and

01:36.590 --> 01:37.950
simple right.

01:38.030 --> 01:46.860
But if I run this function again I'll have to go through this step again and add 80 to that answer.

01:46.970 --> 01:54.950
And if I do this again again do the same thing I've ran the calculation three times but what if this

01:54.950 --> 01:59.540
operation took a really really long time.

01:59.600 --> 02:06.540
What if I had a console log here and we can imagine that this operation takes multiple seconds.

02:06.710 --> 02:15.250
It takes a long time every time we run this function will have to run longtime three times and go through

02:15.250 --> 02:17.450
this step one by one.

02:17.620 --> 02:24.250
Even though we've done the exact same calculation three times is there a way that we can optimize this

02:25.260 --> 02:30.850
and this is where we can use caching and memorization.

02:31.170 --> 02:35.170
Let's improve the above function by doing something different.

02:35.280 --> 02:42.230
I'm going to create a new object called cache that's going to hold an empty object.

02:42.450 --> 02:47.840
We're also going to have a function that is now going to be called memorized.

02:49.010 --> 02:54.220
Not memorized memorized add to Haiti.

02:54.250 --> 03:01.570
That takes a number and inside here we're going to do something a little bit different than the above.

03:01.570 --> 03:07.010
We're still going to add to 80 but we're gonna do it in a special way.

03:07.120 --> 03:18.460
I'm going to say that if n is in cash and this is a way to check if a property exists in an object in

03:18.460 --> 03:26.670
JavaScript so it's similar to me doing cache dot and to check for the property this one just reads better

03:26.670 --> 03:27.720
so I'm going to keep it like that.

03:27.720 --> 03:39.650
So with an exists in cash so if we've cashed it before then simply return the cash dot and or cash and

03:41.740 --> 03:45.790
so return the cached value but obviously it's empty.

03:45.790 --> 03:48.980
The first time around so this is not going to work.

03:49.740 --> 03:53.380
If there's nothing in the cache which is the case the first time around.

03:53.490 --> 04:07.170
Well we have an L statement and in here we're going to have our cash an which doesn't exist yet and

04:07.170 --> 04:21.340
assign it and plus 80 so that after this if we do something like minimized ad to eighty five it's going

04:21.340 --> 04:24.060
to say five plus 80.

04:24.340 --> 04:33.870
So in here we're going to cash the property five to have a value of eighty five which is what we're

04:33.870 --> 04:35.190
doing here.

04:35.190 --> 04:41.100
So that the next time around we're doing something like this.

04:41.160 --> 04:47.880
We go through the if statement find the fact that we've already calculated five and just do simple property

04:47.940 --> 04:56.750
access which as we know is all one time is super fast with the hash table like this let's complete this

04:56.750 --> 04:59.260
example to show you how it works.

04:59.360 --> 05:03.330
I'm just simply going to return

05:10.100 --> 05:17.630
since we just fill it up here and let's just have a console log here that does long time to see that

05:17.990 --> 05:21.170
we're doing the calculation that takes a long time.

05:21.350 --> 05:28.950
The first time I run this function I get eighty five and whoops I have the cash refilled.

05:29.020 --> 05:30.940
So it didn't calculate the longtime.

05:30.940 --> 05:32.040
Let's try that again.

05:32.270 --> 05:34.810
Click Run longtime.

05:35.040 --> 05:40.950
The first pass through it went through here and did this calculation that hypothetically is going to

05:40.950 --> 05:42.440
take a really long time.

05:42.480 --> 05:47.490
Again we're using a nice easy example here but you can imagine this being a calculation that takes a

05:47.490 --> 05:50.100
long time many seconds.

05:50.190 --> 05:54.450
What if we do this again we can console that like here

05:57.990 --> 06:01.140
to make sure that we capture these values

06:04.580 --> 06:12.640
and we'll label them one and two just so we can distinguish them.

06:12.700 --> 06:21.890
So the first goal and the second call if I hit run look at that first time around we call longtime and

06:21.890 --> 06:23.300
we calculate two eighty five.

06:23.600 --> 06:31.400
But the second time around because this value was in the cache we didn't have to do this long calculation

06:31.430 --> 06:35.290
and we just returned it immediately.

06:35.300 --> 06:37.670
So what is memorization.

06:37.700 --> 06:46.640
Exactly well memorization is a specific form of caching that involves caching the return value of a

06:46.640 --> 06:53.960
function that is the return value of this function based on its parameters.

06:53.960 --> 07:03.210
And if the parameter of this function doesn't change like it is here then it's memorized.

07:03.260 --> 07:09.590
That is it uses the cache because it's calculated the same thing before with the same parameter.

07:09.680 --> 07:16.060
And it will return a cached version of the function it's memorized.

07:16.340 --> 07:23.570
If the parameter changes well it's a different parameter that it's never seen before.

07:23.570 --> 07:28.140
So it's going to calculate both times different things.

07:28.230 --> 07:31.120
And I just noticed here that this shouldn't be five it should be.

07:31.290 --> 07:33.150
And over here so it's dynamic.

07:33.150 --> 07:33.780
There you go.

07:33.810 --> 07:35.670
That's better.

07:35.670 --> 07:42.990
So remember this memorization is simply a way to remember a solution to a cell problem.

07:42.990 --> 07:45.600
So you don't have to calculate it again.

Let's talk about currying now currying is the technique of translating the evaluation of a function

00:10.160 --> 00:12.090
that takes multiple arguments.

00:13.070 --> 00:20.690
Into evaluating a sequence of functions each with a single argument that sounds pretty confusing doesn't

00:20.690 --> 00:20.780
it.

00:21.680 --> 00:23.860
Well you can't think of currying like this.

00:23.900 --> 00:32.540
You take a function that can take multiple parameters and instead use incurring modify it to a function

00:32.930 --> 00:37.820
that takes one parameter at a time let's have a look at an example.

00:38.120 --> 00:39.600
I can create a function.

00:39.720 --> 00:50.760
Multiply in this multiply takes a and b as parameters and we're just going to multiply a and b if I

00:50.760 --> 00:56.560
do multiply three times four I should get twelve.

00:56.700 --> 00:58.450
Nice and easy.

00:58.480 --> 01:01.840
How can we use currying here well.

01:01.950 --> 01:09.720
Remember we want to change the function from taking multiple parameters to taking a parameter at a time

01:11.220 --> 01:12.910
we can do something like this.

01:12.930 --> 01:25.010
I can say const curried multiply and we're going to take a parameter which is going to return another

01:25.010 --> 01:35.350
function that takes another parameter and that is going to multiply A times B because of closures we

01:35.350 --> 01:44.920
have access inside of the B function to the a variable and make sure I say const here.

01:44.940 --> 01:45.760
There you go.

01:45.780 --> 01:47.810
Now how can we use this.

01:47.910 --> 02:00.170
Well I can now say curried multiply four or less to five times three if I run this.

02:00.420 --> 02:01.680
Well no that doesn't work.

02:01.680 --> 02:05.440
Remember because this is Curry It takes one parameter at a time.

02:05.910 --> 02:15.350
So instead I'm going to create five which is going to give us the first variable in the way that I like

02:15.350 --> 02:21.110
to look at Aero functions is that I can mimic how the function is written in the way that I call the

02:21.110 --> 02:21.540
function.

02:21.650 --> 02:24.300
So I see two brackets here with a and b.

02:24.320 --> 02:26.470
So I can call it with a and b.

02:26.590 --> 02:29.030
So if I do three here and run.

02:29.030 --> 02:29.750
There you go.

02:29.750 --> 02:38.700
I get 15 so I'm giving the function one parameter at a time but why is this useful.

02:38.700 --> 02:43.740
I can now create multiple utility functions out of this.

02:43.740 --> 02:55.400
For example I can say const code multiply by five which is going to equal this creed multiply with the

02:55.400 --> 02:56.660
parameter of five.

02:57.860 --> 03:07.010
So that now I've called this function once and this function for the rest of its time or at least this

03:07.010 --> 03:14.900
function is going to remember this piece of data five for well forever until we finish running the program

03:15.350 --> 03:23.750
so that let's say 10 years from now we finally remember oh we have this code multiply by five function

03:24.380 --> 03:32.570
I can use the multiplied by five function and multiply anything that we want by five let's say four

03:33.080 --> 03:42.230
five run this I get twenty and instead of running this function over and over I've run it once and now

03:42.230 --> 03:46.110
this code multiply by five is there for us to use.

03:46.250 --> 03:55.490
So if it's a function that gets called many many times we only run this part of the function once which

03:55.760 --> 04:02.870
is really really cool incurring almost reminds you of those methods.

04:02.880 --> 04:07.180
Right on prototypes that were shared amongst objects.

04:07.350 --> 04:15.280
They're trying to save on memory or at least the amount that our computers has to work now that we have

04:15.340 --> 04:16.430
seen occurring.

04:16.450 --> 04:20.680
Let's go to the next topic that gets often confused with curry.

04:21.340 --> 04:22.620
I'll see in the next one.

04:22.760 --> 04:22.990
Bobby.
